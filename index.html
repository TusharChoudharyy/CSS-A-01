        The most common way to add CSS.is to keep the styles in External CSS
        files. How ever,<span class="highlight2">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>
        because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it
        yourself.

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.
</p>

<br>
<p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>
<br>
<p>
There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
